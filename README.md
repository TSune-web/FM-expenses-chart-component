## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS
- Fetch API
- Live Server (VS Code extension for development)
* My solution with vanilla JS requires this extension to display data from a local JSON file. *

### What I learned

1. SASS/SCSS basics
    - Variables
    - Nesting
    - Partials
    - Modules
    - at-rules (@use, @import, etc.)

2. JSON
    - Use fetch API to read


### Continued development

- Working with JSON files
- Fetch API

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Tip: Loading a Local JSON File without Fetch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z92PqSyUBSI) - This YouTube video shows another approach to handling json files.
- [Sass: Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This is a user-friendly resource to learn Sass/Scss.
