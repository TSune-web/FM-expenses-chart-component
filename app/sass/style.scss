// @import vs @use
// both provide mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets
// and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together. (Modularization)

// @use is recommended as @import is said to be removed from the language entirely. (ref: Sass doc)
// @import makes all variables, mixins, and functions globally accessible.
// This makes it very difficult to tell where anything is defined.

// For more details, Sass docs (https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import).
